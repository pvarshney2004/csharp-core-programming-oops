## 📂 Branch Structure

### 🔹 `🧩class-and-object` branch
The **class-and-object branch** focuses on the **fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C#.  
This branch introduces how to **define classes, create objects, use attributes (fields), and implement methods**, which form the foundation of scalable and maintainable C# applications.

#### 📁 Levels
- ## 📘 Level 01 – Class and Object Fundamentals
  This level emphasizes **basic class design**, object creation, and method implementation using real-world examples.
